EXAMPLE CODE FOR ANALYSES PERFORMED IN THE PAPER: 
"Learning-induced shifts in mice navigational strategies are unveiled by a minimal behavioral model of spatial exploration"

MATLAB code reproducing the paper analysis : 
- HexMaze_Code_Beh : Computes Relative Trial Length and Distance from Optimal Path as described in the paper.
- HexMaze_Code_Sim : Compares statistical distribution of Relative Trial Length between experimental data and data obtained from modelling a virtual agent following a parametrised behaviour. 
\
The MATLAB .mat file 'HexMaze_ExData' contains a sample of the experimental data (Build-Up, 1st Session) and can be used to run the code. It can also be used to get the input data format for the available code.
